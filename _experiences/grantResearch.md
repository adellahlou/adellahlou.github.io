<p> I received grants to evaluate available smartphone inertial positioning practices. Ultimately, I explored lightweight, context-aware positioning algorithms. This means that the application would try to identify context and adapt the calculation to account for things like activity (running, biking) or phone placement. </p>

<p> I used an Android phone and a basic robot to collect accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data as well as collected video data to evaluate origins of relative positioning error in different contexts. </p>
