I believe one of the greatest applications of AI is in education. A feasible solution must be widely accessible without the need for expert knowledge in AI programming. I conducted research on a new design approach for Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), and motivated SimClass, an approach that reduces the need for extensive programming and emulates class scripting and prep that already happens today. It relies on vicarious learning from a range of virtual peers that also may be imperfect, recreating a typical class setting. The interactions would be "scripted" by a teacher with minimal training, so that class prep costs are kept low and could still be customized to meet varying county standards.
