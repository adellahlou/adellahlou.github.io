  I interned at Microsoft on the CRM Product's Data Services team. I worked on a P0 feature to make scalable file storage and make files a first-class entity for other features.
</p>
<p>
  This P0 feature was kicked off by interns who owned everything from system design, to user experience, security, and deployment. I worked on the actual storage micro-services, handling the organization lifecycle, caching, and securing critical assets. This allowed us to deliver a satisfying, fast experience while meeting strict security standards.

  During my time at Microsoft I worked with different Azure techonologies such as Key Vault and RDB, as well as Reliable Actors and Services on Azure Service Fabric.
