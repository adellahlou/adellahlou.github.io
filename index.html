            My name is Adel and I am currently a senior finishing my BS and MS in computer science at Northwestern University. I am committed to using data science, software engineering, and design to solve our greatest challenges; empowerment, accessible health, education, and infrastructure.

    <h2> My values </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep growing: </strong> everyday is a good day to get better in anything we want, so let's use it to the fullest.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Share freely: </strong> great things happen when people communicate - ideas build, hearts swell, spirits lift - make sure you put in your part!
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Be mindful: </strong> look around and revel for a moment in how much history it took to get you to sit right there and read my cool site. Unbelievable right?
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dance a little: </strong> dance to your favorite song for a measure or six and imagine if everyone had a hop in their step. Remember, small things can make a big difference.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> About Me</h2>
    <p> I love being active. Over the years I've picked up things like running cross country, boxing, and swing and salsa dancing. I grew up in Northern Virginia, near Washington DC, where I enjoyed running half marathons in 90+ degree days in the summer as well as making snowmen and hot chocolate during the winter.
    </p>

    <p> Other times when I don't have as much energy, I like to cook some of my familys Moroccan or Filipino dishes, read, or play video games such Super Smash Bros.
