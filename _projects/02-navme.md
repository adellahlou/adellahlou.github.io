NavMe is a vision to make indoor environments accessible by crowd sourcing unique landmarks from the vision-impaired community and friends. NavMe was designed with a focus on scalability and user safety, using the crowd to collect and verify the landmarks as well as a rule-based expert system to validate inputs and detect decay.

NavMe's initial design and user testing was done with The Friedman Place in Chicago, a vision-impaired community, where we tested wrist and cane based form factors for both collecting landmarks from users and giving directives.
